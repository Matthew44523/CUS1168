//In terms of readability Java is easier to read as a more straight forward syntax. One aspect
//that may make C++ harder to read is its use of pointers. It all generally comes down to preference and personal experience.

//In terms of ease of programming Java also tends to be easier in most aspects as its standard libraries may be easier
//to understand and use.
